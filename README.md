#### ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Hi there, I'm a Software Engineer! ðŸ‘‹ | ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨ Hola, Soy Ingeniero en Software! ðŸ‘‹ | ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Ciao, I sono un Ingegnere del Software! ðŸ‘‹ 

Hello! Iâ€™m a Software Engineer based in the Washington, DC area, specializing in building native applications for both mobile and web platforms. I bring expertise inâ€¯Swift,â€¯Kotlin, andâ€¯JavaScript, enabling me to lead testing efforts, provide technical support, and develop end-to-end solutions for both existing and greenfield projects.

- **SwiftUI Focus:** I am currently concentrating on mastering `SwiftUI`, Apple's declarative framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms. This approach allows for more intuitive and efficient UI development, aligning with modern best practices in iOS development.â€‹

- **Expanding Skill Set:** I am actively learning `Android` development to broaden my expertise in mobile platforms. This includes gaining proficiency in Kotlin and understanding Android's unique design patterns and architecture, which will enable me to create cross-platform applications.
  
- **Collaborative Opportunities:** I am eager to collaborate on projects that involve `Swift`, `Kotlin`, `JavaScript`, or `Python`. Working across these languages will allow me to contribute to diverse teams and projects, leveraging my skills to build robust and scalable applications.
